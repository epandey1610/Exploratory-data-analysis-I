# Cardiographic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled **"Cardiographic.ipynb"**, where Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to a cardiographic dataset. The purpose of this notebook is to analyze, visualize, and derive insights to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Features of the Notebook

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handling missing values.
  - Renaming columns for clarity.
  - Converting data types for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Summary statistics.
  - Visualization of data distributions and relationships between features using:
    - Pie charts
    - Bar plots
    - Scatter plots
    - Heatmaps for correlation analysis.

- **Categorical Analysis**:
  - Custom visualization using a `plot_categorial` function to generate pie charts and bar plots for each categorical variable.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) implementation to reduce dataset dimensions for easier visualization and clustering.

- **Clustering Analysis**:
  - Agglomerative clustering with three clusters to identify patterns or groupings within the dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or above
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `sklearn`

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eshan16pandey/EDA1.git
   cd EDA1
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Cardiographic.ipynb"
   ```
3. Follow the step-by-step analysis in the notebook.
